Based on our chemical intuition, we can tell that the triple and double bonds of both molecules \"match\" one another; however, simple (geometric) molecular alignment based on three-dimensional coordinates does not identify that. The pivotal step is defining a representation that contains bonding information, and then using permutation Procrustes to match atoms between the two chemical structures. \n",

The two-sided permutation Procrustes (`Procrustes.permutation_2sided`) with one-transformation can be used to find the optimal matching of the two matrices."
